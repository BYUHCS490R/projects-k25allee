            1. The viewport meta tag is important because it will allow our page to adjust when on different size screens/devices. It's so the page looks nicer and it can be changed to fit content better on different devices/so it doesn't zoom stuff out.
            <br>2. You can adjust the css for printing by creating a new css stylesheet and copying the original CSS code into it. You then adjust the stylesheet link by telling the pag if the media is just for screen or printing. You can then change the new CSS file and put the nav display as none.
            <br>3. You would want to adjust it when there's a possibility that the information you have on your webpage will be printed, usually articles or other important information.

                1. We need it so our webpage is adjusted depending on the device it's being pulled up on. They change depending on the device dimensions.
                <br>2. The CSS listens to the last instruction recieved, which means both will run but only the last instruction/one at the very bottom is shown to have worked on the final page.
                <br>3. You can change the CSS through using the @media tag in the Css page and setting a max width. You can then make changes to make your content look nicer and fill in any empty space/gaps.
