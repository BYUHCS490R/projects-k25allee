        <br>2. The root is where your project/website starts, it is the root folder. The path in our url will match the different folders and files/will know where to find specific files that are in the root. Whatever is in the path will be shown when the root/server is accessed.
        <br>3. A default document is a file that's named index.html, so instead of being given an index/summary (when you've only specified the folder and not the file) you have this page show up for whatever folder. It is how you create your home page and every folder can have one.
        <br>4. An absolute link is a link to somebody else's website, you copy and paste it into your web page (it needs a link). A relative link is a link to one of your own webpages/projects (you only need the file name). You would use a relative link because it's not as much to type and it is yours/already in your projects/folders. If you want to link something from a different folder, you have to define the folder.

        <br>6. The 3 rules with relative links are include the folder name that the link is in (1), if we want to go up a folder we use two periods (2), and start over that starts with just a slash, which won't work for us because it won't include whatever folder after root (3).

        <br>8. No, they do not always have to be in the nav tag.
