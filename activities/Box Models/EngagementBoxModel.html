            <br>1. The difference between block tags and inline tags are that block tags create a box/rectangle on our screen (like a the space/information between a tag and the end tag) and are the default/called normal flow (demand 100% width), and inline tags (like the span tag) make it so whatever we select stays in line with the rest of the text. Most tags we use are block tags and we usually put inline tags in block tags. Block/box tags are mostly about the spacing. (Box align only aligns text, not the box itself).
            <br>2. The margin is the ouside of the box where you can push the box away from things outside/on the side of the box and helps control spacing. The border is able to create a series of patterns/lines to outline box tags/boxes. The padding is on the inside of a box and it helps control spacing, pushing the content inside of the box and away from the edge. (Box align only aligns text, not the box itself).
            <br>3. The units of measurement are pixels (px), percentages, em units that convert decimals to prcentages
            <br>4. The figure tag is another block tag that can surround an image (images are not block tag) and make it so it's not line with text (going over on Monday).
