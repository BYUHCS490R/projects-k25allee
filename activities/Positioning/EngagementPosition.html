            1. Normal flow is when it takes up the length of the screen. It is the default way things are placed on the webpage before adjustments are made.
            <br>2. Float makes the text float or wrap around the picture/place it to one side of the picture. It allows text to share space with it. We need to clear the float, so that any unwanted text stays in it's original position and sort of separates it so it's not on the same line.
            <br>3. Relative adjusts the position of things, telling it to move relative from the original position (only really use it when alignment is off). Absolute will cause the thing's space to not be reserved, so it will be like it wasn't there to the text, and it is taken out of the regular flow of context. Fix fixes it to the side of the window and it moves with the page when scrolling.
            <br>4. We use the block tag for vertical navigation and inline block tag for horizontal navigation, including padding, colors, and other decorations to make it look nice.
            <br>5. We can find video reviews/lectures in the module section connected to the engagement assignments and projects we have due for that week/topic.
