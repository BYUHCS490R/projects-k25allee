    <p>The doctype tag tells us what type of html we're using, which is html:5. The html tag contains the code. The head tag helps to index our webpage while the body tag has everything that will show up on our webpage. Meta tags help describe our page, like the characters that can be displayed or other characteristics. They can also control how our webpage is viewed, making sure it looks the way we want it to.</p>
