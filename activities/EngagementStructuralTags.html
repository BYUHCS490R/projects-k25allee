    <p>1. Structural tags are basically the structure of your website, how it looks, and the ease in which you can use it.</p>
    <p>2. The Header is usually the title of the webpage/organization, the logo, and the banner that appears at the top of every webpage. It's what the site is/about.</p>
    <p>3. The Nav tag is the main links on the website we have, usually at the top and taking you to other sections of your own website. Nav should not include links to other websites. You can put it inside the header, but it doesn't have to be in there, it's up to you. Navigation can also be vertical.</p>
    <p>4. The Main is the meat of your page, otherwise known as why you made your webpage, containing the information you wanted to share with others.</p>
    <p>5. The footer is the stuff that has to be on the webpage, but isn't being highlighted, such as additional links, legal policies, social media links, copyright notice, and just additional information.</p>
    <p>6. HTML validation makes sure that you typed everything correctly, so that the website doesn't have to guess at what you want. If it is green, everything is good, the validator will highlight errors you've made. Try fix first error and then see if it fixes anything else in your html code.</p>
