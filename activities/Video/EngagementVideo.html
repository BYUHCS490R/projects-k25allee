        <h2>Answers: </h2>
        <p>
            1. You don't have to worry about the copyright if youtube allows you to embed and put it in your website, and it's free. If you're selling something, the youtube video might direct customers to other places for products. There is a validation error caused by the frameborder part of the code, which can be fixed by deleting it and removing the border using CSS.
            <br>2. Transform can give things a more natural feeling, and can help you to animate things on your webpage.
            <br>3. Wednesday is learning about boot strap and then we're taking a practice final exam (we get 100% by showing up) on Monday and actual final exam on Wednesday. An update is due next week with the project and the final exam is also next week.
