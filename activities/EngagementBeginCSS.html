        <br>1. HTML attributes that control color have been removed and shouldn't be used. Inline CSS is seen in the example above and can be added in the main/paragraph tag, but we shouldn't use it (it can work, but using it makes you lose points in this class). It's possible to use inline CSS to text how things look, but make sure to turn it into external CSS before submitting. Embedded CSS can be put in the header tag and can cause conflicts with the other styles. External CSS means it is put in a separate file and then applied to the project/web page you want. HTML attribute overrides inline CSS, inline CSS overrides embedded 
        <br>2. We should only use external CSS because it helps to keep our code organized and we don't have to worry as much about getting overridden by CSS inside the code. Having it all in one place helps and if you have multiple pages for your projects, you only need one CSS sheet/file for all of them.
        <br>3. The selector is designed to choose which tag gets what property and is the tag that is put in front of the curly bracket. It makes it so you don't have have to have separate files for each selector/tag.
