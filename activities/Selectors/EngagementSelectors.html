            1. We can select items through the tag name it's under, the descending rule (which basicall specifies which tag inside of something), and giving certain tags a name/id to refer to.
            <br>
            2. They both work the same, but the ID tag uses a hashtag and the class tag uses a period. The ID tag means were naming something and we can only use that name once on our page. The class tag allows us to reuse our names when naming something and are a lot more powerful. You can give something multiple classes.
            <br>
            3. The span tag selects text in a line, so you can have different text styles right next to each other/on the same line. A div tag selects stuff aswell, but also divides your line of text. Basically, div tag wants it's own line while the span tag doesn't.
            <br>
            4. Div tag can be the default if you don't need anything specific done to your tag.
            <br>
            5. We can change color by name, RGB (or creating your own color) and RGBa, hue/saturation/value, or short/long hexcode (doesn't matter if uppercase or not).
