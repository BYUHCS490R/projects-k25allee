            1. The "action" attribute specifies where the form/data should be sent when it gets submitted.
            <br>2. The "method" attribute helps to specify the (HTTP) method that is used to send the form data to whatever server you have put down, using Get and Post.
            <br>3. The get will show your information in the url when you input data while Post will not show it. Get broadcasts what you're inputting, which means if you're just using a public wifi, someone can tune in and see your information. Https makes websites more secure, it scrambles your information so people can't see it while it's traveling. Since https will scramble your stuff, it doesn't neccesarily matter which one you use, but there's a difference between your data being shown in the url or not. Post is when our action is supposed to change/add/update/delete something or when we don't want our info just on display. Get is when you're just reading things (like looking up information and observing it) or sharing a search that you just did with someone else.
            <br>Other: After the "?" in an url it is called the query (q=), which is asking a question.

            1. Different ways to style our form are to use a div tag with classes to change the position of our boxes/page elements. We also use fieldset to show different sections on our page and legend to label those sections. You can use the div/specific class tag you assigned in the html and pick out specific tag names that you want to change, being able to change color, font, and more.
            <br>2. With just one or two added properties, our page is able to smoothly adjust from desktop to mobile and back. It is a more fast/efficient way to arrange our page/make our page look good on either screen.
            <br>Different html5 form controls: date, email, phone, datalist, color, number, range, etc.

            1. Javascript is a programming language like C++ and Python. It got it's name from a fight between two companies who wanted web dominance. The company Sun Microsystems made the programming language and it was named after someone named Java, so that people would associate it with the web.
            <br>2. Two ways you can run Javascript are in a browser (with a html page)/in the DOM and Node js that allows us to do it on the backend/run it like Python.
            <br>3. The most popular front-end js library was the jQuery library, which did all the checks and would run the right code for whatever browser was being used.
            <br>4. The most popular front-end js library now is React, which is open-source, and is used to build both desktop and mobile webpages. React native can help to load your web page/browser in a web application. Electrum makes VSC work with html, css, etc.
