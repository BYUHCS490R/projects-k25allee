            1. The "action" attribute specifies where the form/data should be sent when it gets submitted.
            <br>2. The "method" attribute helps to specify the (HTTP) method that is used to send the form data to whatever server you have put down, using Get and Post.
            <br>3. The get will show your information in the url when you input data while Post will not show it. Get broadcasts what you're inputting, which means if you're just using a public wifi, someone can tune in and see your information. Https makes websites more secure, it scrambles your information so people can't see it while it's traveling. Since https will scramble your stuff, it doesn't neccesarily matter which one you use, but there's a difference between your data being shown in the url or not. Post is when our action is supposed to change/add/update/delete something or when we don't want our info just on display. Get is when you're just reading things (like looking up information and observing it) or sharing a search that you just did with someone else.
            <br>Other: After the "?" in an url it is called the query (q=), which is asking a question.

            1. Different ways to style our form are to use a div tag with classes to change the position of our boxes/page elements. We also use fieldset to show different sections on our page and legend to label those sections. You can use the div/specific class tag you assigned in the html and pick out specific tag names that you want to change, being able to change color, font, and more.
            <br>2. With just one or two added properties, our page is able to smoothly adjust from desktop to mobile and back. It is a more fast/efficient way to arrange our page/make our page look good on either screen.
