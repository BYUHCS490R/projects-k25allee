    <h1>Engagement Activity GitHubHelp Answers</h1>
    <p>You can get help by coming to Portable 2 during the lab hours and request help through the tutoring website. Engagement activities are started in-class and due at 11:59 later that day. We can't turn in late or missing assignments, but we can drop 4 of them.</p>
    <p>Projects are due on Wednesdays at 11:59, but you can turn it in until 5 am if it's a bit late. If you miss it, you get 4 resubmissions.</p>
    <p>We talked about this on Friday, so here's what I answered for that: The doctype tag tells us what type of html we're using, which is html:5. The html tag contains the code. The head tag helps to index our webpage while the body tag has everything that will show up on our webpage. Meta tags help describe our page, like the characters that can be displayed or other characteristics. They can also control how our webpage is viewed, making sure it looks the way we want it to.</p>
