    <p><span class="gi">Genshin Impact</span> is an open-world fantasy RPG, made by HoYo, where you can meet a variety of different characters to add to your team and fight enemies, while also discovering the secrets of the world you're traveling through. The game follows the one sibling/traveler players pick at the beginning of the game, under the name of Aether or Lumine, as they search for their lost sibling and rescue the people in the world they've found themselves in. The world explored in Genshin Impact is called Teyvat, which has 7 main nations: <span id="mo">Mondstadt,</span> <span id="li">Liyue,</span> <span id="in">Inazuma,</span> <span id="su">Sumeru,</span> <span id="fo">Fontaine,</span> <span id="na">Natlan,</span> and <span id="sn">Snezhnaya.</span> Each nation has an element, an ideal, and a ruler for each, with the player doing quests to find information about what happened to this world and how their sibling plays a role in all of it.</p>
    <p><span class="gi">To be honest,</span> I've never actually played Genshin Impact, mostly because I'm not great at games, and the gacha pull aspect of the game would cause me to spend too much time on it. Instead, I've watched and read up on much of the lore of both the characters and nations, enjoying the complexity of the characters and how they deal with obstacles in their lives. Genshin also has incredible graphics, world-building, voice acting, and character designs, which are all part of why I love the game, despite not having it. Genshin Impact has such a big community of fans, who love the game itself and the characters with all kinds of passions and motivations they can relate to and pull for their collection.</p>

        <li id="gold">I chose a color similar to goldenrod yellow for emphasis, because it's different from the blue that fills the page, making it stand out as a unique color.</li>
        <li>I chose a darker shade of blue than my background to ensure my text was readable and didn't draw as much attention as the header/links, although it can look a bit black if you stare at it too long.</li>
        <li>I mostly based my colors on the colors of my hero/character, but I did use the little color square that allows you to make your own color and coolors to see if they would go together. All the colors on my webpage are taken from the colors assigned to different areas and characters in the game.</li>
