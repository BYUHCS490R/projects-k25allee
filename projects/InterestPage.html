    <p>Genshin Impact is an open-world fantasy RPG where you can meet a variety of different characters to add to your team and fight enemies, while also discovering the secrets of the world you're traveling through. The game follows the one sibling/traveler players pick at the beginning of the game, under the name of Aether or Lumine, as they search for their lost sibling and rescue the people in the world they've found themselves in. The world explored in Genshin Impact is called Teyvat, which has 7 main nations: Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya. Each nation has an element, an ideal, and a ruler for each, with the player doing quests to find information about what happened to this world and how their sibling plays a role in all of it.</p>
    <p>To be honest, I've never actually played Genshin Impact, mostly because I'm not great at games, and the gacha pull aspect of the game would cause me to spend too much time on it. Instead, I've watched and read up on much of the lore of both the characters and nations, enjoying the complexity of the characters and how they deal with obstacles in their lives. Genshin also has incredible graphics, world-building, voice acting, and character designs, which are all part of why I love the game, despite not having it. Genshin Impact has such a big community of fans, who love the game itself and the characters with all kinds of passions and motivations they can relate to and pull for their collection.</p>
