            <p>Cookie Run Kingdom (CRK) is considered an action role-playing gacha game where you can battle against monsters and other players on the app. You are given a starter team of cookies and go off to produce items, fight monsters, learn more about the world you find yourself in, and build your own kingdom, while also having the opportunity to pull for more characters to strengthen your team. CRK is still updating it's story, creating more events for players to participate in and characters we get to learn more about, leading to many theories to be made regarding the lore of the game. The main continent players experience/explore is called Crispia, where the main world-building is explored, with progress currently being made on another continent named Beast-Yeast, which will contain more difficult characters to fight against.</p>
           
            <p>Some of the characters significant to the story's lore are the Ancient Hero cookies, consisting of a team of 5, who have existed for many years in-game. Each character has a different kingdom they come from, value attached to them represented by magical artifacts called soul jams (truth, passion, resolution, abundance, and freedom), and, most recently, a nemesis/counterpart they must face/overcome to ensure they and the people they care about are not destroyed. As seen in the image above, Pure Vanilla Cookie is in the middle with the soul jam of truth, Hollyberry Cookie is at the top with the soul jam of passion, Dark Cacao Cookie is on the right with the soul jam of resolution, Golden Cheese Cookie is on the left with the sould jam of abundance, and White Lily Cookie is at the bottom with the soul jam of freedom. The main villain the heroes had to fight was called Dark Enchantress Cookie, but recently they've had to face Beast cookies, who are their villainous couterparts and the heroes who came before them, needing to be true to their values in order to win against them.</p>
