        <p>I chose to do my photo tour on some of the places I visited when I was in Japan this past summer (2025) with my family. While we were there, we celebrated one of my younger brother's birthday, took many pictures, and went shopping. We were able to enjoy both sunny and rainy days, meet up with family friends, and spend time with family who had also decided to travel to Japan. Here are some of the highlights of our trip!</p>
