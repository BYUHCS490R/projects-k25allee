    <h1>&spades;Ace Quarteza Archives&spades;</h1>
    <p>My name is Ace Quarteza, an arcane archer and heir to the house of Spades of the noble Carddeck family. Being the only remaining member of the Spades house, I am currently on the run after the bitter Clubs and Hearts houses placed a bounty over my head, as to try to take my inheritance for themselves. My findings have taken me on a quest to find seven crystal roses, hidden in this world, that will unlock the Spades family vault, finding my first rose with a witch.</p>
    <p> My journey has led to my presence in the kingdom of Shyl√°m, where I found my second crystal rose with a local barkeeper and received an invitation to enter the castle. The morning after staying in the castle, it was discovered that the king had been murdered. With twelve suspects on the board and no way to leave until the case was solved, I had no choice but to team up with <em>three idiots, a cauldron, and a chicken</em>, so I could continue on with my journey and leave this kingdom. Unfortunately, as we have investigated this tragic mystery, more secrets have been uncovered, leading us to wonder what has really been going on in these castle walls.</p>
