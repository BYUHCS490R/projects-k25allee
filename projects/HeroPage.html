            Furina de Fontaine was the archon (ruler) of Fontaine, the nation represented by the element of hydro and the ideal of justice, before it was revealed that she hadn't been the actual archon and was only acting as one. Having been asked by the true archon, Focalors, to play her role to save the people of Fontaine from a prophecy that would have brought ruin to them all, Furina had a heavy burden to carry that only she could know about. For 500 years, she was able to keep her secret and act as the archon without suspicion until the traveler showed up and helped to uncover the truth. In the end, Furina's efforts successfully saved Fontaine from the prophecy, and she is now able to live life as she wants, without any need to act. Although struggling to find herself and figure out what she wants to do with her life, Furina was able to reconnect with the friends she had had when she was the archon and work on having the support system she needed.

            <dd>In the Court, Furina acted as one of the judges when trials were conducted, although the final verdict was always delivered by the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, a tool used to decide whether someone in court was innocent or guilty, and was later utilized to expose the truth regarding the hydro archon.</dd>

            <dd>In addition to being the archon and a judge, Furina had a love of performing for the people of Fontaine on the stage, being an actress and singer. It did take a little while for her to get back into acting after years of putting on a facade, but she realized it was something she truly loved doing.</dd>

            <dd>Although Furina was not the true archon, the archons of the other nations still consider her to have been on equal standing with them, finding her actions to help save Fontaine commendable and her mental strength to be very admirable after playing her role for so long.</dd>
