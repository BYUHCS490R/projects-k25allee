        <h2>Bungo Stray Dogs</h2>
        <p>
            Bungo Stray Dogs (BSD) is a manga, with an anime adaptation, written by Kafka Asagiri and illustrated by Sango Harukawa, first released in 2012. BSD follows our main character, Atsushi, as he joins a detective agency of people with supernatural abilities and goes head-to-head with other organizations that threaten the city of Yokohama. The characters in this series are all based on real life authors from all around the world, taking inspiration from their lives and stories, while also having their own struggles and special characteristics. The manga, and by extension the anime, is still ongoing (the most recent chapter being 126), with various light novels and other art having been published/being developed today.
