    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>The internet is a global network that is able to connect all of our computers together, allowing us to access information and be able to communicate with others.</p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>It is a system or "web" of interlinked documents, media, and different resources that are able to be accessed/used through the internet.</p>
    <h2>Internet & Web Differences</h2>
    <p>One main difference between the internet and the web is that the network is the network, while the web is one part of it and it needs the internet to run. The internet usually emphasizes certain hardware that is needed to run it, while the web is usually used to access browsers or websites.</p>
    <h2>ASCII & Unicode</h2>
    <p>The ASCII table is a chart consisting of 128 different symbols, numbers, and letters and their corresponding numerical code that computers can interpret in code (ex: C++). ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Unicode seems to be an international version of the ASCII table, being usable for different languages and scripts with each symbol having a unique numerical value.</p>
    <h2>UTF-8</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 stands for Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit. UTF-8 seems to be a bit similar to ASCII & Unicode in which it utilizes a character encoding standard that represents all the characters in languages from around the world, being able to include special characters or emojis.</p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>The URL is the address of our web pages that tells us the location of a piece of information or a resource, often being useful when sharing sources with others.</p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>The domain name is one part of a web address that represents it as belonging to a specific domain and helps us more easily identify where our resource is from or who it's by.</p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is the language/protocol that is used to transfer information and requests between networked devices or web browsers and web servers.</p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTPS stands for Hyper Transfer Protocol Secure and is basically a more secure version of HTTP, as it encrypts the information being sent and recieved to offer more privacy/security of personal information.</p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>IP stands for internet protocol, so the IP adress is a unique line of characters/numbers that each device you connect to the network gets assigned that acts as an identifier, allowing devices to communicate and have online functions.</p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System, which takes the Domain names from web addresses and translates/turns it into an IP address that is easier for devices to use to locate/access data using browsers.</p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>W3C stands for World Wide Web Consortium. W3C is a set of standards/guidelines, that have been agreed upon and endorsed by the members and director of this organization, whose focus is to improve the World Wide Web to make it safer and better for users.</p>
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and it is a markup language/file format that allows users to define and store data as structured information. XHTML stands for Extensible HyperText Markup Language and it is a cross/mix between XML and HTML, making HTML able to work with other data formats. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the standard markup/programming language that is usually used in the creation of web pages/applications. HTML5 stands for HyperText Markup Language 5, in simple terms it is the 5th version and the one most used presently when creating web pages/applications.</p>
