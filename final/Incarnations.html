        <h2>What is an incarnation?</h2>
        <p>Incarnations are people who participate in the scenarios, broadcasted live on the Star Stream, and are usually just normal people who have been thrust into a new normal where they have to try their best to survive. While majority of the people shown in ORV are human/humanoid because of the planetary system, incarnations can be a variety of different species depending on where the scenarios take place or what the scenarios are. Incarnations are given a few opportunities to decide whether or not they want to be sponsored by a constellation, if an offer is made by the constellation, who can help to grant them power and coins to help their survival, but it's important to keep in mind what kind of person they're agreeing to work with. While being sponsored by a constellation can be helpful, incarnations also develop skills/power based on something they specialized in before the scenarios started, like Dokja who is/was an avid reader getting abilities based on book terms, and can even grow to be quite powerful without a sponsor.</p>
        <p>Incarnations can even grow to become constellations if they gain enough stories, coins, and power to do so, although it is considered a rare occasion, but was proved to be possible by Kim Dokja. The incarnations listed below in the table are some of the more main characters to be featured in the novel, with a quick glimpse of some of the things they can do. All these characters are a part of Kim Dokja Company, a nebula (the definition being expanded upon in the constellation tab) founded by Kim Dokja and backed up by some of the constellation supporters who were following Dokja on his journey through the scenarios. In one of the main scenarios, incarnations were ranked by strength and given a title, with some recieving their title at a later date as they grew in strength.</p>
