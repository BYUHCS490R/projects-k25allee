            1. The topic of my final project will be a webnovel/novel called Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint by the Korean author duo under the pen name sing N song. The title of my webpage/project will be: Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint: A Summary (or something along those lines, possibly being referred to by it's acronym ORV).
            <br>2. Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint (ORV) is an apocalyptic modern webnovel with fantasy elements that has gained much popularity over the years, even having physical copies being produced in English, and is something I discovered a couple of years ago because it was recommended to me by a friend. I wanted to use ORV as my topic to be able to share with other people/friends a story/characters that I connected with, especially with it's relatable themes of being a reader and what it truly means to love the characters you read about. ORV is also just something I enjoy/am interested in and felt like I could research/share a lot of content on, as well as not being the center of one of my past projects, like some of my other interests are. 
            <br>3. My home page will contain a summary of the webnovel, the different media interpretations it has, and a bit of background information/defining of terms to better help the reader understand my topic. For my first page, I would be introducing the world the webnovel is set in, touching a bit on the genres it represents, what the power system is, and what circumstances our characters find themselves in. My second page would be an introduction to the incarnations (a term from the novel)/main characters, utilizing a table to organize the different pieces of information I want to share about each of them. My third page would be about the constellation (a novel term) characters and other higher powers that affect the characters and the plot, possibly using a table or cards to organize their information. My fourth page would be about the dynamic between three of the most important/significant characters in the story, explaining the effect they had on one another and how that moved several events in the novel to happen. My fifth page would consist of any information about the author, where to find the book, and some reviews/comments people have made regarding the novel/story, including my form.
            <br>4. As I mentioned before, my table will hold information about the main characters in the novel, possibly having details like their names, powers, constellation sponsors (to be explained), aliases/titles, and other important pieces of information. As for my form, I would probably structure it to be in a similar format as when people leave comments on other people's work. It would include an area for their name, email, the date, the comment they would like to leave, maybe a datalist/dropbox where they can share the character they liked best based on what they learned on the website, maybe an option to rate how helpful this web page was, a small inside joke (using the radio input), and a submit button.
            <br>5. I will probably be using the webnovel/novel and the webtoon adaptation as two of my sources/references, while also looking up some websites reviewing the novel, the wiki containing details from the source material, and just doing some general research on different topics I might want to expand upon. I might struggle a bit with finding images, but I plan to look up pictures that at least include the cover of the novel/webtoon and seeing if it would be okay to take some panels of the webtoon to use for this project, maybe even looking at fanmade content.
            <br>6. I acknowledge that I have read the warnings below/in the assignment and will continuously check what images would be okay to use for this project.
