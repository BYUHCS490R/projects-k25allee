            <h2>What are Constellations?</h2>
            <div class="constinfo">
                <p>Constellations are known as mysterious beings in the ORV world, being the spectators of the tragedies occurring in the universe the scenario is happening. Constellations can offer to become a sponsor for an incarnation, which means they'll be able to share coins, skills, or power if the incarnation chooses them during the selection periods. Although having some support can be helpful in their apocalyptic world, there are some constellations that might try to use the incarnations for their own power/enjoyment with little care of what the people the sponsor want, so it's best to consider your options before making a decision. Speaking of the selection process, none of the constellations go by their real names when interacting with the incarnations, instead going by a modifier, which can make it hard to tell who they might be/their intentions if you don't have a lot of knowledge regarding history or if you didn't read the original novel like Kim Dokja.
                    <br>
                    Most of the time, constellations aren't able to manifest directly into the scenarios, usually lending items and support through the Dokkaebis' channels, unless they use a large portion of probability as a sacrifice for their presence. While some constellations come from different mythologies and stories from the past, there is always a chance an incarnation can become a constellation if they have enough stories (feats) and are recognized by the Star Stream, which can sometimes be hard if you are being sponsored by another constellation. Kim Dokja, relying on this fact, refused to take on a constellation sponsor, and became a constellation himself after the 10th scenario. There are even groups of constellations, mostly made up of constellations of the same mythology, called nebulas, with incarnations being able to form their own if they have support from at least 5 other constellations and enough coins. Kim Dokja also uses this to form his own nebula called Kim Dokja Company, so as not to be under the thumb of another constellation/nebula. Down below are some of the constellations that pop up the most in the story.

                <p>This picture was taken on a family trip/vacation to Canada, where we got to experience Canada day and a delayed flight home. My mom's name is Adrienne, and she's part of our stake's primary presidency, while my dad's name is Nathan, and he's the current bishop of our ward. My parents have been together for a little more than 20 years, having met briefly on this island and again through friends at BYU.</p>

                <p>My name is Alyssa, and I am the creator of this webpage, in addition to being the oldest child/only daughter in my family. I am currently attending BYUH, majoring in Computer Science, after graduating from Kamehameha Schools. I have a special love of fantasy/fiction that I developed in high school, where I started a Fantasy club at school with some friends. I enjoy playing D&D with my friend group, sleeping, creating, reading, and scrolling on my phone.</p>

They both enjoy getting on call with their friends and playing video games, although it does make it harder to see them when they spend all their time in their rooms...</p>
