                The ORV novel takes place in a modern apocalyptic setting and can be considered a reverse transmigration story, as a work of fiction is transported/merged with the real world. ORV also contains some educational information as Korea's history is brought up quite a bit and some characters are based on different religions/mythology, such as the Greek pantheon. Although fantasy isn't really one of it's main genres, there are many elements that are reminiscent of it with the power system, monsters, items, and worlds that are visited

                In the first part of ORV, the setting is Seoul, Korea, with the story later expanding to include other parts of the world and even different worlds, universes, and timelines, all of which are explored by our main characters. What are the scenarios? The scenarios are different objectives people must fufill if they want to survive, usually given with a difficulty and time limit, assigned by the Star Stream. The Star Stream is essentially a platform that assigns the scenarios and where the incarnations/people are being broadcasted to the constellations/mysterious beings that can choose to help or harm the participants, run by Dokkeabis (described as fluffy demons with horns). The story of ORV starts and (loosely) ends on a Subway, with it being the background when the scenarios first started and when Kim Dokja and his companions faced the person behind the scenarios. For the first scenarios, the participants are limited to the people who were in the capital cities when the apocalypse first started, being blocked from the outside world by a glowing dome, before they expanded to the world.

                As for the power system in ORV, the more stories (or feats.) you have, the stronger you're ranked having less to do with raw strength/power, but what you've done and the impact it has had on others (whether it be told through history or is a unique situation). For incarnations, the power or stats, for people who are familiar with video games, they start with depends on what they did prior to the apocalypse starting. For instance, Kim Dokja, who was primarily characterized as being a reader, gained abilities relating to it with having an increased reading speed and being able to use the skills of characters from the original novel if his understanding of them was high enough. Another example could be Yoo Sangah, who had been studying new languages, and was able to translate some words from creatures not of their world, helpful when trying to identify weaknesses or warning others. Teaming up with a constellation (which is expanded upon on another page), can also help to increase your power/chances of survival, but it can sometimes come with a cost, so it's good to be careful.
