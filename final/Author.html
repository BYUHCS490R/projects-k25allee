                    SingNsong, also known as Sing Shong or Sing-Syong, is a pseudonym used by the married couple that co-authored Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint and some other creative works. The couple was inspired to make ORV because of a thought they had of what a story is/means to readers, focusing on the perspective of readers, as they had been before they started writing. Inspiration came from the idea that everyone expresses thoughts/feelings that are read by others, which is essentially how we share our stories with the people around us. A final message these two authors hoped to share with readers, as shown through an interview, was that sometimes the stories of other people help people to get through difficult times in their lives, giving them the motivation to keep moving.
