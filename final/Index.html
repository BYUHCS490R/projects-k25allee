            <p>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint (ORV) is an apocalyptic modern webnovel with fantasy elements that has gained much popularity over the years, starting online before being published/produced as physical copies being sold all over, written by the the Korean duo Sing n Song. It follows the main character, Kim Dokja, who was just an average salaryman before the webnovel he just finished comes to life right before his eyes, turning the world into chaos. While going through different challenges, Dokja is able to meet the characters he only was able to read about before the apocalypse began, including the protagonist, Yoo Joonghyuk, a regressor who has already lived through a few loops in an attempt to reach his own happy ending. In an attempt to change the ending of the story, Dokja uses the knowledge he got through reading through the entire webnovel to keep both himself and his new companions, a mix of people from his own world and the novel world, alive with help from the supernatural beings that have popped up.</p>

            <p>ORV has a bunch of different media floating around presently with physical copies of the webnovel, a webtoon adaption with both online and physical copies in store, art books/pieces, merchandise, and a live action movie (which unfortunately changed much of the story and disappointed many readers). It was even announced in 2024 that ORV will be getting an animated series, granted there is no official release date yet. The main story consists of 551 main story chapters with an ongoing side story and the webtoon is currently ongoing at 291 chapters (the latest ones being behind a paywall to be released in due time). ORV has become a story that many people have connected with, especially with the idea of what it means to be a reader and love fictional worlds so much, using it to distract from a harsh reality.</p>
